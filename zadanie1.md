## prpr-projekt1

This is a project for 1st semester class "Procedural programming". Projects is about working with dynamic arrays, multiple functions, pointers and strings. The program reads entries from "autobazar.txt" and calls functions based on user input.

List of functions that need to be made:

**f_v() (printing entries on stdout):**
 - [x] fgets() information in file
 - [x] combine name and surname into one char
 - [x] print structured information in output
 
**f_o() (calculating bonuses for employees who have been working for more than a year):**
 - [x] calculate how long has the employee been working in shop
 - [x] calculate the bonus for sale
 - [x] print structured information in output
 
**f_n() (creating dynamic array):**
 - [x] deallocate memory if it has been already allocated
 - [x] create dynamic array of 'spz'
 
**f_s() (dividing every entry in dynamic array into three parts):**
 - [x] check if array has been created
 - [x] print structured 'spz' in console (AA 111 BB)
  
**f_m() (finding most frequent letter or number in dynamic array):**
 - [x] check if array has been created
 - [x] print most common letter in array and the number of occurence

**f_p() (finding palindromes in dynamic array):**
 - [x] check if array has been created
 - [x] print 'spz' which are palindromes
  
**f_z() (finding most frequent region in dynamic array):**
 - [x] check if array has been created
 - [x] print all regions with most sold cars
 
**k (program termination):**
 - [x] end program

**bugfixing**
 - [x] f_o() prints more names than should

**NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED**

**f_x() (deleting entries from dynamic array based on user input)**

**f_h() (generating a histogram from the last two letters of every entry in dynamic array)**
