## prpr-projekt2

This is a project for 1st semester class "Procedural programming". Projects is about working with structures and linked lists and using them in multiple functions. The program reads entries from "reality.txt" and calls functions based on user input.

List of functions that need to be made:

**f_n() (creating linked list from entires in file):**
 - [x] fgets() information in file
 - [x] create linked list of entries in file
 
**f_v() (printing entries in linked list on stdout):**
 - [x] print structured information in output
 
**f_p() (adding entries into linked list):**
 - [x] read entry from stdin
 - [x] insert entry on nth place from stdin
 
**f_z() (removing entries from linked list):**
 - [x] remove entries which location contains string from stdin
 - [x] redirect pointers connecting linked list
  
**f_h() (finding entries in linked list based on price):**
 - [x] scanf price from stdin
 - [x] print all entries with lower or same price

**f_a() (updating linked list based on location):**
 - [x] scanf location from stdin
 - [x] update all entries which contain the location from stdin
 
**k (program termination):**
 - [x] end program

**NEW FUNCTION ADDED**

**f_u() (sorting entries in linked list according to city or price)**
